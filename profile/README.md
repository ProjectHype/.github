# Welcome to Hype!
ProjectHype is a coding language where you can turn your code into a App or a Website! (Hopefully)

One of our goals it to make Hype easy for new coders while also being a little complicated.

Example:
```java
@import: hypemain;
@import: hypeconnections;
@import: hypegathers;
@importurl: https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:ital,opsz,wght@0,14..32,100..900;1,14..32,100..900&display=swap

{hypehead}:
    {windowtitle - "Welcome to my Hype App / Website!"}!
    {windowlogo - "(logos/logo.png)"}!
    {hypedesc - "Hello to my Hype Website / App!"}!
    {hypeconnect - "(looks.hyl)"}!
    {hypeconnect - "(hypescript.hys)"}!
{hypehead - end}

{hypemain}
    /// This is a Comment! ///
    {header1 - "Hello!" group: "verybigtext" gather: "big-text"}
{hypemain - end}
```
