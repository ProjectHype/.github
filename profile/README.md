# Welcome to Hype!
ProjectHype is a coding language where you can turn your code into a App or a Website! (Hopefully)

One of our goals it to make Hype easy for new coders while also being a little complicated.

Example:
```python
!@import hypegathers;

{function: "donothing"}: [
    {set text with gather: "bigtext" to: "Very Big Text!"}
]
```
